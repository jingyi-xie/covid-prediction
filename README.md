# IDS721 Final Project: Covid Prediction

In this project, we built a **machine learning** model to predict the number of Covid positive cases and deployed it on **Flask**. The Flask app is deployed on **Google App Engine** and can be accessed through a public url. We also verified the elastic scale-Up performance via Load Test with **Locust**.
* Application Url: https://covid-prediction-311000.uc.r.appspot.com
* ML Framework: Sklearn
* Platform: Flask + Google App Engine
* Load Test Framework: Locust
* Dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jingyi-xie/covid-prediction/main/national-history-update.csv
